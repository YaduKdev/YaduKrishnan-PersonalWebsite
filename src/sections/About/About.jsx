          <p>
            &nbsp;I'm Yadu Krishnan, a highly motivated and aspiring web developer with a strong passion for creating innovative and user-friendly digital experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;On the frontend, I excel with the React JS and utilize Angular, complemented by strong proficiency in design and styling using Sass and 
            Tailwind CSS. For the backend, I am adept at developing scalable server-side logic using the Node.js runtime environment, developing REST APIs, 
            and managing data efficiently across diverse database systems, including MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. While I possess academic knowledge 
            in Python, I am focused on leveraging my extensive practical experience in full-stack JavaScript development to deliver high-quality, end-to-end 
            solutions.
